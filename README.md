## Use
Run ```car_controller.py``` automatically at startup on the Raspberry Pi Zero.

To drive the car:
1. Switch on power at the battery case.
2. Wait for bootup, until the green indicator light is flashing slowly (~ 1 minute).
3. Press the A button to fully engage the car. The indicator light will go solid.
4. Drive by using the 2 joysticks. The left stick powers the left 2 wheels, and the right stick powers the right wheels. They work forward and reverse.
5. Press the X button to toggle the headlights on and off.
6. Press A again to turn the car off. The indicator light will flash. Wait until all lights on the Raspberry Pi Zero are off (~ 20 seconds).
7. Switch off power at the battery case.

## Building the car
